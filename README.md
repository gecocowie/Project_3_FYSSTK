# Project 3 FYS-STK 4155
In this project i have used Random Forest and Multi-layer perceptron regression to model the snow water equivalent in the californian Toulumne basin. 

## Repo stucture
In this repository There are three jupyter notebook scripts, one for loading the 

### Folders
*test_runs:* Selected prediction results and the test and training data that was used to create the results
*Data:* Folder containing the data used in this project. The data consists of static terrain features and Snow water equivalent measurements
*Figs:* Folder containing the figures used in the report
### Scripts
**Neural_Network.ipynb:** Script performing the Multi-layer perceptron regression.

**Random_forest.ipynb:** Script performing the random forest regression

**Read_Tuolumne_data.ipynb:** Loads data and separates into variables. This script is run by Random_forest.ipynb and Neural_Network.ipynb
